This contains the code for my 4th year undergratudate capstone project. The first few folders are mostly me experimenting with the initial code and making some changes.

This was initially based off code by Anna Cestaro, a summer undergraduate intern at Armagh Observatory in summer 2024.

I feel that all of these have at least some interesting aspect to them which is why I have kept them. (I think - honestly I have forgotten what exactly is in each and what advances were made each time. I unfortunately did not keep a changelog).

# 1
This would be the initial code that was written by Anna, so because I did not write it I haven't uplodaded it.

# 2 Theoretical
The initial changes I made to the code to  produce lines of different ratios and lines that are dependent on different lines.

# 3 Misc
Some messing around with inputs and fitting.

# 4 Wavelength Spectra Code
Made lines dependent on others for their velocity and profiles.

Also introduced redshifts.

# 5 Multiple
Converted the spectrum generation to be object oriented.

Also made the code iterate many times varying profiles and velocities. However I realised this was not relevant so it was abandoned halfway through.

# 7 False Pos
This code generates spectra with and without falsly detected lines for different line ratios. A neural network is trained on all of this data and then can be tested on other data.
