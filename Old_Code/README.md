I feel that all of these have at least some interesting aspect to them which is why I have kept them here. (I think - honestly I have forgotten what exactly is in each and what advances were made each time. I unfortunately did not keep a changelog).

# 1
This would be the initial code that was written by Anna, so because I did not write it I haven't uplodaded it.

# 2 Theoretical
The initial changes I made to the code to  produce lines of different ratios and lines that are dependent on different lines.

# 3 Misc
Some messing around with inputs and fitting.

# 4 Wavelength Spectra Code
Made lines dependent on others for their velocity and profiles.

Also introduced redshifts.

# 5 Multiple
Converted the spectrum generation to be object oriented.

Also made the code iterate many times varying profiles and velocities. However I realised this was not relevant so it was abandoned halfway through.
